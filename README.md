## 📂 Dataset Description & Data Structure  

### 📌 Data Source  
- Source: Google analytic database.
- Size: The dataset has 338 columns. In this project, using only 17 columns

### 📊 Data Structure & Relationships  
Table using in this project:  

| Field Name | Data Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| fullVisitorId | STRING | The unique visitor ID. |
| date | STRING | The date of the session in YYYYMMDD format. |
| totals | RECORD | This section contains aggregate values across the session. |
| totals.bounces | INTEGER | Total bounces (for convenience). For a bounced session, the value is 1, otherwise it is null. |
| totals.hits | INTEGER | Total number of hits within the session. |
| totals.pageviews | INTEGER | Total number of pageviews within the session. |
| totals.visits | INTEGER | The number of sessions (for convenience). This value is 1 for sessions with interaction events. The value is null if there are no interaction events in the session. |
| totals.transactions | INTEGER | Total number of ecommerce transactions within the session. |
| trafficSource.source | STRING | The source of the traffic source. Could be the name of the search engine, the referring hostname, or a value of the utm_source URL parameter. |
| hits | RECORD | This row and nested fields are populated for any and all types of hits. |
| hits.eCommerceAction | RECORD| This section contains all of the ecommerce hits that occurred during the session. This is a repeated field and has an entry for each hit that was collected.|
| hits.eCommerceAction.action_type | STRING | "The action type. Click through of product lists = 1, Product detail views = 2, Add product(s) to cart = 3, Remove product(s) from cart = 4, Check out = 5, Completed purchase = 6, Refund of purchase = 7, Checkout options = 8, Unknown = 0. Usually this action type applies to all the products in a hit, with the following exception: when hits.product.isImpression = TRUE, the corresponding product is a product impression that is seen while the product action is taking place (i.e., a ""product in list view"")." |
| hits.product | RECORD | This row and nested fields will be populated for each hit that contains Enhanced Ecommerce PRODUCT data. |
| hits.product.productQuantity | INTEGER | The quantity of the product purchased. |
| hits.product.productRevenue | INTEGER | The revenue of the product, expressed as the value passed to Analytics multiplied by 10^6 (e.g., 2.40 would be given as 2400000). |
| hits.product.productSKU | STRING | Product SKU. |
| hits.product.v2ProductName | STRING | Product Name. |
